### What I learned

I practiced more the use of Vue.js. I learned how to create elements with drag and drop functionality, and I learned how to add dark/light functionality to the website. This was my first project in Vue.js using Vite with deployment on GitHub Pages. Additionally, I continued to practice my HTML and CSS skills. It was very fulfilling to complete this challenge.
